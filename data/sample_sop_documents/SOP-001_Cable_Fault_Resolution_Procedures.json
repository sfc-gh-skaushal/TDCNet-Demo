Notify traffic control if working near roadways\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STEPS:\n1. Verify fault code 812.3 on Cisco cBR-8 router display\n2. Check signal levels using spectrum analyzer\n   - Forward path: Should be -7 to +7 dBmV\n   - Return path: Should be 16 to 54 dBmV\n3. Perform cable continuity test using TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer)\n4. Identify fault location within 2-meter accuracy\n\nREPAIR PROCEDURE:\n1. Isolate affected cable segment\n2. If underground cable:\n   - Contact utility marking service (mandatory)\n   - Use cable locator to trace exact path\n   - Excavate carefully using hand tools near cable\n3. If aerial cable:\n   - Inspect for physical damage, animal interference\n   - Check guy wires and support structures\n4. Replace damaged cable section with approved splice kit\n5. Test signal integrity before restoration\n6. Document GPS coordinates of repair location\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Confirm error code 812.3 clears from system\n2. Test downstream signal levels at customer premises\n3. Verify no packet loss over 15-minute test period\n4. Update network topology database\n\nESTIMATED TIME: 4-8 hours depending on access complexity\nREQUIRED SKILLS: Cable splicing certification, TDR operation\nTOOLS REQUIRED: TDR, spectrum analyzer, splice kit, excavation tools\n        "
