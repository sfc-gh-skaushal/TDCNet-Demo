These issues rarely affect customer service but\nshould be corrected to prevent escalation.\n\nQUICK DIAGNOSTIC:\n1. Check current signal levels on Casa C100G CMTS\n2. Compare with baseline measurements from last maintenance\n3. Identify if deviation is upstream or downstream\n4. Check weather conditions and temperature logs\n\nADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE:\n1. Access CMTS web interface or CLI\n2. Navigate to RF configuration section\n3. For downstream adjustment:\n   - Modify output level in 0.5 dB increments\n   - Target range: 45-50 dBmV at amplifier output\n4. For upstream adjustment:\n   - Adjust input attenuator settings\n   - Target range: 0 to -10 dBmV at CMTS input\n5. Allow 5 minutes for system stabilization\n6. Verify modem registration levels\n\nVERIFICATION:\n1. Confirm error code 100.1 clears within 10 minutes\n2. Check that all modems remain online\n3. Verify no new alarms generated\n4. Document changes in maintenance log\n\nESTIMATED TIME: 30 minutes to 1 hour\nREQUIRED SKILLS: Basic RF knowledge, CMTS operation\nTOOLS REQUIRED: Signal level meter, laptop\n        "
