# TECHNICIAN_TYPE Field Name Fix

## Problem
SQL compilation error: `error line 82 at position 4 invalid identifier 'TECHNICIAN_TYPE'`

## Root Cause
Field name mismatch between the source table and target table:
- **Source table (`NETWORK_FAULTS`)**: Uses field name `TECHNICIAN_TYPE_REQUIRED`
- **Target table (`TECHNICIAN_METRICS`)**: Expects field name `TECHNICIAN_TYPE`
- **Query**: Was trying to use `TECHNICIAN_TYPE` directly from the source

## Solution
Fixed the INSERT statement in `sql/data_loading/load_fault_data.sql` to properly map the field:

### Before (causing error):
```sql
SELECT 
    TECHNICIAN_TYPE || '_' || LOCATION || '_' || FAULT_CATEGORY || '_' || TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE(), 'YYYYMM') AS METRIC_ID,
    TECHNICIAN_TYPE,  -- ❌ This field doesn't exist in source
    ...
GROUP BY TECHNICIAN_TYPE, LOCATION, FAULT_CATEGORY;  -- ❌ Invalid field reference
```

### After (working):
```sql
SELECT 
    TECHNICIAN_TYPE_REQUIRED || '_' || LOCATION || '_' || FAULT_CATEGORY || '_' || TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE(), 'YYYYMM') AS METRIC_ID,
    TECHNICIAN_TYPE_REQUIRED AS TECHNICIAN_TYPE,  -- ✅ Proper field mapping
    ...
GROUP BY TECHNICIAN_TYPE_REQUIRED, LOCATION, FAULT_CATEGORY;  -- ✅ Correct source field
```

## Files Modified
- `sql/data_loading/load_fault_data.sql` - Fixed field mapping in TECHNICIAN_METRICS INSERT statement

## Verification
✅ All SQL syntax validation tests pass
✅ Field mapping correctly handles the name difference between source and target tables

## Impact
- No functional changes to the demo
- Proper data loading for technician performance metrics
- Maintains consistency between table schemas and data loading logic
