# TDC Net Snowflake Demo - Complete Solution Summary

## 🎯 Demo Overview

This comprehensive Snowflake demo showcases how TDC Net can transform their network fault resolution process from reactive to proactive, directly addressing their primary KPI: **First Time Fix Rate**.

### Business Problem Addressed
- **Low First-Time Fix Rate** - TDC Net's most critical operational KPI
- **Inefficient Field Operations** - 20-30 minutes per job searching documentation
- **Reactive Maintenance Model** - No predictive capability for equipment failures
- **Sub-optimal Technician Dispatch** - Generic technicians sent to specialized faults

### Solution Architecture
**Unified Snowflake Platform** delivering end-to-end AI-powered fault resolution:
1. **Cortex Analyst** for predictive fault classification and prioritization
2. **Cortex Search** for AI-powered technical documentation assistance
3. **Streamlit Apps** for intuitive user interfaces (manager + field engineer)

```bash
# Clone or download the demo files
cd "TDCNet Demo"

# Generate sample data
python data/generate_sample_data.py

# Install local dependencies for testing
pip install streamlit pandas plotly numpy faker
```

### 2. Snowflake Configuration (45 minutes)
```sql
-- Execute in order:
-- 1. sql/setup/01_database_setup.sql
-- 2. sql/setup/02_table_creation.sql
-- 3. Upload data files to stages
-- 4. sql/data_loading/load_fault_data.sql
-- 5. sql/data_loading/load_sop_documents.sql
-- 6. sql/cortex_models/fault_classification.sql
