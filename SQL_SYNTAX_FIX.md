# SQL Syntax Fix - GENERATED ALWAYS AS Issue

## Problem
The original table creation script used `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` syntax for computed columns:

```sql
CREATED_DATE DATE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (DATE(FAULT_TIMESTAMP)),
RESOLUTION_DATE DATE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (DATE(RESOLUTION_TIMESTAMP)),
IS_RESOLVED BOOLEAN GENERATED ALWAYS AS (RESOLUTION_TIMESTAMP IS NOT NULL),
BUSINESS_HOURS_FAULT BOOLEAN GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    HOUR(FAULT_TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN 8 AND 17 
    AND DAYOFWEEK(FAULT_TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN 2 AND 6
)
```

This syntax caused compilation errors:
- `syntax error line 30 at position 22 unexpected 'GENERATED'`
- `syntax error line 21 at position 32 unexpected 'ALWAYS'`
- `syntax error line 21 at position 39 unexpected 'AS'`

## Root Cause
The `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` syntax for computed columns is not supported in all Snowflake versions or may require specific syntax variations.

## Solution
Replaced computed columns with a view-based approach:

### 1. Simplified Table Definition
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE NETWORK_FAULTS (
    FAULT_ID VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    FAULT_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP_NTZ,
    -- ... other columns ...
    TECHNICIAN_TYPE_REQUIRED VARCHAR(50),
    ESTIMATED_REVENUE_IMPACT FLOAT,
    PRIORITY_SCORE FLOAT
    -- Removed computed columns
) COMMENT = 'Network fault logs from COAX and Fiber infrastructure';
```

### 2. Created Enhanced View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW VW_NETWORK_FAULTS_ENHANCED AS
SELECT 
    *,
    -- Derived fields for analytics
    DATE(FAULT_TIMESTAMP) AS CREATED_DATE,
    DATE(RESOLUTION_TIMESTAMP) AS RESOLUTION_DATE,
    (RESOLUTION_TIMESTAMP IS NOT NULL) AS IS_RESOLVED,
    (HOUR(FAULT_TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN 8 AND 17 
     AND DAYOFWEEK(FAULT_TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN 2 AND 6) AS BUSINESS_HOURS_FAULT
FROM NETWORK_FAULTS;
```

### 3. Updated All References
Updated all SQL scripts and views to use `VW_NETWORK_FAULTS_ENHANCED` instead of `NETWORK_FAULTS` where computed fields are needed:

- `sql/cortex_models/fault_classification.sql`
- `sql/cortex_models/cortex_search_setup.sql`
- `sql/data_loading/load_fault_data.sql`
- `sql/setup/02_table_creation.sql` (other views)

### 4. Updated Streamlit Applications
Modified the data loading functions in Streamlit apps to compute the derived fields locally when simulating the Snowflake environment.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Compatibility**: Works with all Snowflake versions
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify computed logic without altering table structure
3. **Performance**: Views are optimized by Snowflake query optimizer
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized logic in the view definition

## Files Modified

- `sql/setup/02_table_creation.sql` - Removed computed columns, added enhanced view
- `sql/cortex_models/fault_classification.sql` - Updated table references
- `sql/cortex_models/cortex_search_setup.sql` - Updated table references  
- `sql/data_loading/load_fault_data.sql` - Updated table references
- `streamlit_apps/manager_dashboard/app.py` - Added local computation of derived fields
- `demo_scripts/setup_instructions.md` - Updated verification steps

## Verification

Run the SQL syntax validation script:
```bash
python test_sql_syntax.py
```

All SQL files should now pass syntax validation without the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` errors.

## Impact on Demo

- **No functional impact** - All computed fields are still available through the enhanced view
- **Same user experience** - Streamlit applications work identically
- **Better compatibility** - Works across different Snowflake environments
- **Easier deployment** - No version-specific syntax requirements

The demo functionality remains exactly the same, but with improved SQL compatibility.
