**Objective:** Demonstrate how TDC Net can transform fault resolution from reactive to proactive using Snowflake's AI capabilities

---

## Opening (2 minutes)

### Welcome & Context Setting
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today I'm excited to show you how TDC Net can leverage Snowflake's AI capabilities to transform your network operations and significantly improve your most critical KPI - the First Time Fix rate.

**Current Challenge:**
- TDC Net faces high operational costs due to inefficient fault resolution
- Field engineers spend 20-30 minutes per job searching complex documentation
- Low First Time Fix rate due to reactive maintenance and sub-optimal technician dispatch
- Difficulty distinguishing minor alerts from critical 'big faults'"

### Solution Preview
"Today's demo shows a unified solution within Snowflake that addresses both challenges:
1. **Proactive fault triage** using AI to predict and prioritize critical faults
2. **AI-powered field guidance** that delivers instant, summarized repair procedures

Let's see this in action..."

## Vignette 1: From Reactive Alarms to Proactive Triage (12 minutes)

### TELL #1 - Set the Stage (3 minutes)

**Business Context:**
"Imagine you're a Network Operations Manager at TDC Net. Every day, your team is flooded with network alarms. The challenge? Distinguishing between minor issues and major faults that could impact thousands of customers.

**Current Pain Points:**
- General technicians dispatched to complex cable faults → second visits required
- Critical repairs delayed while resources handle minor issues
- No predictive capability to prevent customer impact

**Success Vision:**
A dashboard that automatically flags major faults, predicts their criticality, and recommends the right specialist technician - all before customers are significantly affected."

### SHOW - Live Demonstration (7 minutes)

**[Switch to Manager Dashboard]**

"Let me show you our Network Operations Dashboard powered by Snowflake Cortex Analyst..."

#### Step 1: Show Raw Data Foundation
- **Navigate to Snowflake interface (if available) or mention:**
  "Behind this dashboard, we have real network fault data from both COAX and Fiber networks flowing into Snowflake..."
- **Key Point:** "All this data is stored and processed within Snowflake - no separate ML platforms needed."

#### Step 2: Demonstrate ML Classification
- **Point to the dashboard metrics:**
  "Notice we have 1,000 fault records with automatic classification into Minor, Major, and Cable Fault categories"
- **Highlight the magic:** "This classification happens in real-time using `SNOWFLAKE.ML.CLASSIFICATION` - pure SQL-based machine learning"
- **Show the fault distribution chart:** "You can see Cable Faults represent only 10% of incidents but affect 40% of customers"

#### Step 3: Priority Scoring & Triage
- **Navigate to the Critical Alerts section:**
  "The system automatically calculates priority scores considering customer impact, fault type, and business hours"
- **Click on a critical fault:** "Here's a cable fault affecting 3,600 customers - the system immediately recommends deploying a specialist technician"
- **Show the priority timeline:** "This visualization shows fault urgency vs. time - notice how cable faults cluster in the high-priority zone"

#### Step 4: Actionable Insights
- **Point to the fault triage table:**
  "Operations managers can now see exactly which faults need immediate attention and what type of technician to dispatch"
- **Highlight SLA breach indicators:** "The system predicts SLA breach risk, enabling proactive intervention"

### TELL #2 - Reinforce Value (2 minutes)

**Business Impact:**
"What you just saw delivers immediate value:
- **Reduced MTTR** for critical repairs through proper technician matching
- **Prevented customer impact** through proactive fault identification
- **Optimized resource allocation** by prioritizing high-impact issues

**Technical Differentiation:**
- Built and deployed a predictive model in minutes, not months
- Everything runs within Snowflake - no complex ML infrastructure
- SQL-based approach your data teams already understand

**Transition:**
But identifying the right fault is only half the battle. Once we dispatch a technician, how do we ensure they can fix it on the first visit? That's where our second vignette comes in..."

## Vignette 2: AI-Powered Guidance for First-Time Fix (10 minutes)

### TELL #1 - Set the Stage (2 minutes)

**Business Context:**
"Now imagine you're a field engineer who just received that cable fault dispatch. You arrive on-site with your equipment, but you need to quickly find the exact repair procedure for error code 812.3 on a Cisco cBR-8 router.

**Current Pain Points:**
- 20-30 minutes spent searching through lengthy technical manuals
- Difficulty matching fault codes to specific procedures
- Risk of incomplete repairs due to missed steps

**Success Vision:**
An AI assistant that instantly provides summarized, step-by-step repair instructions tailored to the specific fault and equipment."

### SHOW - Live Demonstration (6 minutes)

**[Switch to Field Engineer App]**

"Let me show you our Field Engineer Assistant app, designed mobile-first for technicians in the field..."

#### Step 1: Show Assigned Faults
- **Display the fault list:** "The technician sees their assigned faults with priority indicators"
- **Click on the cable fault:** "Let's work on that critical cable fault we identified in the manager dashboard"

#### Step 2: AI-Powered Search
- **Navigate to AI Assistant tab:**
  "Now the technician can ask natural language questions about the repair"
- **Type query:** "How to fix a cable fault with error code 812.3 on a Cisco cBR-8 router?"
- **Show the response:** "Using Cortex Search with `SNOWFLAKE.ML.COMPLETE`, the system instantly searches our technical documentation and provides a contextual answer"

#### Step 3: Step-by-Step Procedures
- **Click 'Get Repair Guidance':**
  "The system generates a complete, tailored repair procedure"
- **Highlight safety warnings:** "Safety requirements are prominently displayed"
- **Show diagnostic steps:** "Clear diagnostic steps with specific equipment commands"
- **Display repair procedure:** "Step-by-step repair instructions with estimated time"
- **Point to verification steps:** "Verification checklist ensures complete resolution"

#### Step 4: Mobile Optimization
- **Demonstrate mobile features:**
  "Notice the mobile-first design - large buttons, clear text, optimized for field use"
- **Show chat interface:** "Technicians can ask follow-up questions and get instant answers"
